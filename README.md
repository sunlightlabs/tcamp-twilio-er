### tcamp-twilio-er 

simple app to help co-ordinate volunteers for tcamp .

this command line app sends smses to volunteers :
- it parses a goog spreadsheet . 
- it puts things into a scheduler . 
- it sends smses via twilio . 
- should be run on the commandline day of tcamp ... 

probably ment to be run day off ... 

TODO ??? 
- find last update timestamp of goog doc
- periodically refresh goog document
- eject things from the schedule and put everything new in
- currently depends on running on a machine w/ time set to same time as tcamp and not UTC ... so smokehouse ...
